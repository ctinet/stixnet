            <summary>
            A Bundle is a collection of arbitrary STIX Objects grouped together in a single container. A Bundle does not have any semantic meaning and 
            the objects contained within the Bundle are not considered related by virtue of being in the same Bundle.
            
            A STIX Bundle Object is not a STIX Object but makes use of the type and id Common Properties. A Bundle is transient, and implementations SHOULD 
            NOT assume that other implementations will treat it as a persistent object or keep any custom properties found on the bundle itself.
            
            The JSON MTI serialization uses the JSON Object type [RFC8259] when representing bundle.

            STIX Cyber-observable Objects
            Objects that represent observed facts about a network or host that may be used and related to higher level intelligence to form 
            a more complete understanding of the threat landscape.
            
            STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs) document the facts concerning what happened on a network or host, and do not capture the who, 
            when, or why. By associating SCOs with STIX Domain Objects (SDOs), it is possible to convey a higher-level understanding of the 
            threat landscape, and to potentially provide insight as to the who and the why particular intelligence may be relevant to an organization. 
            For example, information about a file that existed, a process that was observed running, or that network traffic occurred between two IPs 
            can all be captured as SCOs.

            <summary>
            Specifies the observed encoding for the name of the file. This value MUST be specified using the corresponding name from the 2013-12-20 revision of the IANA 
            character set registry [Character Sets]. If the value from the Preferred MIME Name column for a character set is defined, this value MUST be used; if it is 
            not defined, then the value from the Name column in the registry MUST be used instead.
            
            This property allows for the capture of the original text encoding for the file name, which may be forensically relevant; for example, a file on an NTFS volume 
            whose name was created using the windows-1251 encoding, commonly used for languages based on Cyrillic script.

            <summary>
            Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack Patterns are used to help 
            categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks 
            are performed. An example of an attack pattern is "spear phishing": a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully 
            crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware. 
            Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say
            that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.

        <member name="T:Cti.Stix.Core.SDO.Campaign">
            <summary>
            A Campaign is a grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur 
            over a period of time against a specific set of targets. Campaigns usually have well defined objectives and may be part of an Intrusion Set.
            
            Campaigns are often attributed to an intrusion set and threat actors. The threat actors may reuse known infrastructure from the intrusion set 
            or may set up new infrastructure specific for conducting that campaign.
            
            Campaigns can be characterized by their objectives and the incidents they cause, people or resources they target, and the resources 
            (infrastructure, intelligence, Malware, Tools, etc.) they use.
            
            For example, a Campaign could be used to describe a crime syndicate's attack using a specific variant of malware and new C2 servers against the 
            executives of ACME Bank during the summer of 2016 in order to gain secret information about an upcoming merger with another bank.

            The Course of Action object in STIX 2.1 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing prose courses of action) but does not support 
            the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain properties to represent metadata about courses of action. Future STIX 2 releases will expand 
            it to include these capabilities.
            
            A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress. It may describe technical, automatable responses 
            (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe higher level actions like employee training or policy changes. 
            For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.
            
            The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved action property also serves as a placeholder for future inclusion of machine 
            automatable courses of action.

            A STIX Grouping object might represent a set of data that, in time, given sufficient analysis, would mature to convey an incident or threat report as a 
            STIX Report object. For example, a Grouping could be used to characterize an ongoing investigation into a security event or incident. A Grouping object 
            could also be used to assert that the referenced STIX Objects are related to an ongoing analysis process, such as when a threat analyst is collaborating 
            with others in their trust community to examine a series of Campaigns and Indicators. The Grouping SDO contains a list of references to SDOs, SCOs, SROs,

            <summary>
            Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). 
            For example, Observed Data can capture information about an IP address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence 
            assertion, it is simply the raw information without any context for what it means.
            
            Observed Data can capture that a piece of information was seen one or more times. Meaning, it can capture both a single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) 
            as well as the aggregation of multiple observations of an entity. When the number_observed property is 1 the Observed Data represents a single entity. 
            When the number_observed property is greater than 1, the Observed Data represents several instances of an entity potentially collected over a period of time. 
            If a time window is known, that can be captured using the first_observed and last_observed properties. When used to collect aggregate data, it is likely that 
            some properties in the SCO (e.g., timestamp properties) will be omitted because they would differ for each of the individual observations.

            A dictionary of SCO representing the observation. The dictionary MUST contain at least one object.
            The cyber observable content MAY include multiple objects if those objects are related as part of 
            a single observation. Multiple objects not related to each other via cyber observable Relationships 
            MUST NOT be contained within the same Observed Data instance.
            This property MUST NOT be present if object_refs is provided.
            For example, a Network Traffic object and two IPv4 Address objects related via the src_ref and dst_ref 
            properties can be contained in the same Observed Data because they are all related and used to characterize 
            that single entity.
            NOTE: this property is now deprecated in favor of object_refs and will be removed in a future version.

            Threat Actors are actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be operating with malicious intent. A Threat Actor is not an Intrusion 
            Set but may support or be affiliated with various Intrusion Sets, groups, or organizations over time.
            
            Threat Actors leverage their resources, and possibly the resources of an Intrusion Set, to conduct attacks and run Campaigns against targets.
            
            Threat Actors can be characterized by their motives, capabilities, goals, sophistication level, past activities, resources they have access to, 
            and their role in the organization.

            organization’s motivation—as is common with activists—but more often it supports personal goals. For example, an individual analyst may join a Data Miner corporation 
            because his or her skills may align with the corporation’s objectives. But the analyst most likely performs his or her daily work toward those objectives for personal 
            reward in the form of a paycheck. The motivation of personal reward may be even stronger for Threat Actors who commit illegal acts, as it is more difficult for someone 
            to cross that line purely for altruistic reasons. The position in the list has no significance.

            Tools are legitimate software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks. Knowing how and when threat actors use such tools can be 
            important for understanding how campaigns are executed. Unlike malware, these tools or software packages are often found on a system and have 
            legitimate purposes for power users, system administrators, network administrators, or even normal users. Remote access tools (e.g., RDP) and 
            network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) are examples of Tools that may be used by a Threat Actor during an attack.
            
            The Tool SDO characterizes the properties of these software tools and can be used as a basis for making an assertion about how a Threat Actor 
            uses them during an attack. It contains properties to name and describe the tool, a list of Kill Chain Phases the tool can be used to carry 
            out, and the version of the tool.
            
            This SDO MUST NOT be used to characterize malware. Further, Tool MUST NOT be used to characterize tools used as part of a course of action in

            A Vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or implementations of the computational logic (e.g., code) found in 
            software and some hardware components (e.g., firmware) that can be directly exploited to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, 
            or availability of that system.
            
            CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that provides common names for publicly known problems [CVE]. 
            For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.
            
            The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not 
            yet have an external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted 
            and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance process.

            <summary>
            The Relationship object is used to link together two SDOs or SCOs in order to describe how they are related to each other. 
            If SDOs and SCOs are considered "nodes" or "vertices" in the graph, the Relationship Objects (SROs) represent "edges".
            
            STIX defines many relationship types to link together SDOs and SCOs. These relationships are contained in the "Relationships" 
            table under each SDO and SCO definition. Relationship types defined in the specification SHOULD be used to ensure consistency. 
            An example of a specification-defined relationship is that an indicator indicates a campaign. That relationship type is listed 
            in the Relationships section of the Indicator SDO definition.
            
            STIX also allows relationships from any SDO or SCO to any SDO or SCO that have not been defined in this specification. These 
            relationships MAY use the related-to relationship type or MAY use a user-defined relationship type. As an example, a user might 
            want to link malware directly to a tool. They can do so using related-to to say that the Malware is related to the Tool but not 
            describe how, or they could use delivered-by (a user-defined name they determined) to indicate more detail.
            
            Note that some relationships in STIX may seem like "shortcuts". For example, an Indicator doesn't really detect a Campaign: it 
            detects activity (Attack Patterns, Malware, Infrastructure, etc.) that are often used by that campaign. While some analysts might 
            want all of the source data and think that shortcuts are misleading, in many cases it's helpful to provide just the key points 
            (shortcuts) and leave out the low-level details. In other cases, the low-level analysis may not be known or sharable, while the 
            high-level analysis is. For these reasons, relationships that might appear to be "shortcuts" are not excluded from STIX.

        <member name="T:Cti.Stix.Core.SRO.Sighting">
            <summary>
            A Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen. Sightings are used 
            to track who and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track trends in attack behavior.
            
            The Sighting relationship object is a special type of SRO; it is a relationship that contains extra properties not present on the Generic 
            Relationship object. These extra properties are included to represent data specific to sighting relationships (e.g., count, representing 
            how many times something was seen), but for other purposes a Sighting can be thought of as a Relationship with a name of "sighting-of". 
            Sighting is captured as a relationship because you cannot have a sighting unless you have something that has been sighted. Sighting does 
            not make sense without the relationship to what was sighted.
            
            Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:
              -  What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other SDO (sighting_of_ref)
              -  Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an Identity (where_sighted_refs)
              -  What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as Observed Data (observed_data_refs)
              
            What was sighted is required; a sighting does not make sense unless you say what you saw. Who sighted it, where it was sighted, and what 
            was actually seen are optional. In many cases it is not necessary to provide that level of detail in order to provide value.
            
            Sightings are used whenever any SDO has been "seen". In some cases, the object creator wishes to convey very little information about the 
            sighting; the details might be sensitive, but the fact that they saw a malware instance or threat actor could still be very useful. 
            In other cases, providing the details may be helpful or even necessary; saying exactly which of the 1000 IP addresses in an indicator were 
            sighted is helpful when tracking which of those IPs is still malicious.
            
            Sighting is distinct from Observed Data in that Sighting is an intelligence assertion ("I saw this threat actor") while Observed Data is 
            simply information ("I saw this file"). When you combine them by including the linked Observed Data (observed_data_refs) from a Sighting, 
            you can say "I saw this file, and that makes me think I saw this threat actor".

            the sighting_of_ref property was sighted.
            
            Observed Data has a similar property called number_observed, which refers to the number of times the data was observed. These 
            counts refer to different concepts and are distinct.
            
            For example, a single sighting of a DDoS bot might have many millions of observations of the network traffic that it generates.
            Thus, the Sighting count would be 1 (the bot was observed once) but the Observed Data number_observed would be much higher.
            
            As another example, a sighting with a count of 0 can be used to express that an indicator was not seen at all.

            <summary>
            The Language Content object represents text content for STIX Objects represented in languages other than that of the original object. 
            Language content may be a translation of the original object by a third-party, a first-source translation by the original publisher, 
            or additional official language content provided at the time of creation.
            
            Language Content contains two important sets of properties:
                - The object_ref and object_modified properties specify the target object that the language content applies to.
                    For example, to provide additional language content for a Campaign, the object_ref property should be set to the id of the 
                    Campaign and the object_modified property set to its modified time. Most relationships in STIX are not specific to a particular 
                    version of a STIX object, but because language content provides the translation of specific text, the object_modified property 
                    is necessary to provide that specificity.
                - The content property is a dictionary which maps to properties in the target object in order to provide a translation of them.

            <summary>
            The contents property contains the actual Language Content (translation).
            
            The keys in the dictionary MUST be RFC 5646 language codes for which language content is being provided [RFC5646]. The values each consist of 
            a dictionary that mirrors the properties in the target object (identified by object_ref and object_modified). For example, to provide a 
            translation of the name property on the target object the key in the dictionary would be name.
            
            For each key in the nested dictionary:
                - If the original property is a string, the corresponding property in the language content object MUST contain a string with the content for that 
                  property in the language of the top-level key.
                - If the original property is a list, the corresponding property in the translation object must also be a list. Each item in this list recursively 
                  maps to the item at the same position in the list contained in the target object. The lists MUST have the same length.
                - In the event that translations are only provided for some list items, the untranslated list items MUST be represented by an empty string (""). 
                  This indicates to a consumer of the Language Content object that they should interpolate the translated list items in the Language Content 
                  object with the corresponding (untranslated) list items from the original object as indicated by the object_ref property.
                - If the original property is an object (including dictionaries), the corresponding location in the translation object must also be an object. 
                  Each key/value field in this object recursively maps to the object with the same key in the original.
            
            The translation object MAY contain only a subset of the translatable fields of the original. Keys that point to non-translatable properties in the 
            target or to properties that do not exist in the target object MUST be ignored.
